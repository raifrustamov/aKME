# aKME

This repo contains the code from the appendix of the paper:

Raif M. Rustamov, James T. Klosowski, Kernel mean embedding based hypothesis tests for comparing spatial point patterns, Spatial Statistics, Volume 38, 2020 
(see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00116).

Additionally, I am including the code for the extension of the approach to the 3D setting. While this code can be used in higher dimensions, I did not have a chance to test it.
