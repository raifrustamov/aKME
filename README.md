This repo contains the code from the appendix of the paper:

Raif M. Rustamov, James T. Klosowski, Kernel mean embedding based hypothesis tests for comparing spatial point patterns, Spatial Statistics, Volume 38, 2020 
(see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00116).

Additionally, I am including the code for the extension of the approach to the general d-dimensional setting. I run some basic checks for the 3D case to see if it controls the size; I did not have a chance to check the testing power. Dimensions beyond 3 were not tested at all -- use at your own risk!
